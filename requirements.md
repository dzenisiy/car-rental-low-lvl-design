Technical Assessment - Challenge
Please design and implement a simulated Car Rental system using object-oriented principles.
Requirements
• The system should allow reservation of a car of a given type at a desired date and time for a given
number of days.
• There are 3 types of cars (Sedan, SUV and van).
• The number of cars of each type is limited.
• Use unit tests to prove the system satisfies the requirements.

Requirements Analysis
1. System supports three types of cars - Sedan, SUV, and Van. 
2. Users can reserve a car for a specific date and time, and for a certain number of days.
3. System creates an Order as user makes reservation
4. Price depends on the type of car and the number of days reserved.
5. There is a limitation on the number of cars available for each type.
6. Concurrent booking of the same car: exactly one succeeds


Out of scope
- Payment processing
- Rescheduling(cancellation and rebooking instead)
- UI/rendering
